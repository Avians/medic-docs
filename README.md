# Kujua Docs

Docs live in `md` directory and should be editable locally, so links should be
relative and allow for use of a a Markdown tool like [Mou](http://mouapp.com/).

This is a separate app from Kujua mainly because of its size, since we don't
need to increase the build and replication time of Kujua by weighing it down
with media files.

This site was created using the [Garden Baseline
App](http://garden20.com/baseline-garden-app/) as a starting point and is
deployed to the [Medic Garden](https://medic-dev.iriscouch.com).

## Install

A `git clone` and `kanso push` should be all that is needed to start developing.
